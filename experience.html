            <a href="project.html#aab12"><strong> Optimal Planning of Renewable Energy-Integrated Distribution System with Uncertainties: </strong></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a novel planning framework for the optimal allocation and sizing of renewable energy-based distributed generation units (RDGs), including photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbines (WT). This model incorporates uncertainty by employing probability distribution functions to simulate the stochastic nature of renewable outputs, enhancing the reliability of the power network under fluctuating conditions.</li>
                    <li>The project focused on minimizing power losses, improving voltage stability margins (VSM), reducing voltage deviations, and achieving yearly economic savings. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated on various distribution systems, demonstrating superior performance in enhancing the techno-economic benefits of the distribution systems.</li>

            <a href="project.html#aab8"><strong>Electric Vehicle Integration in Bangladeshi Residential Distribution Grid: </strong></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a Monte Carlo simulation-based stochastic load flow algorithm to analyze the effects of EV integration in three different urban residential neighborhoods of Bangladesh. Additionally, implemented an optimization approach to refine EV charging strategies within the distribution networks</li>
                <li>This study aimed to assess the impact of two EV penetration scenarios (20% and 30%) across different seasons, identifying areas susceptible to voltage collapse and optimizing charging strategies to enhance grid capacity. The research provided insights into how increased EV loads could be accommodated effectively, improving overall grid performance, voltage stability, and reducing power losses, thereby guiding future infrastructure upgrades and policy development for sustainable energy integration.</li>

            <a href="project.html#aab11"><strong>Optimal Load-Shedding in Distribution System: </strong></a>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed an optimal load shedding technique utilizing the Chaotic Slime Mould Algorithm (CSMA) with a sinusoidal map to enhance the efficiency of islanding operations in distribution systems with Distributed Generation (DG). This approach employs a constrained function focused on maintaining static voltage stability margin (VSM) and optimizing total remaining load after shedding.</li>
                <li>This study aimed to address the inefficiencies in contemporary load shedding schemes by ensuring optimal load reduction, preserving frequency and voltage stability under various islanding scenarios. The efficacy of the CSMA was validated against traditional methods like the Backtrack Search Algorithm (BSA) and original Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA) using IEEE 33 and 69 bus radial distribution systems, demonstrating superior performance in maintaining load and voltage stability</li>
